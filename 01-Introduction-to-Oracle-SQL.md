# Introduction to Oracle SQL

## What is Data?

Data is a collection of facts and figures representing information.

### Examples

- Name
- Age
- Gender
- Phone Number
- Email ID

---

## What is a Database?

A Database is a collection of a large volume of facts and figures stored in an organized manner.

### Examples

- University Details
- Hospital Details
- Bank Details
- Employee Details

---

## Management of Facts and Figures

The main objectives of data management are:

- Store data permanently
- Retrieve data efficiently

---

## Data Management in Olden Days

In earlier days, information was stored manually using ledgers.

Managing large volumes of data manually was:

- Time consuming
- Difficult to maintain
- Difficult to retrieve quickly
- More prone to errors

---

## Data Management using Programming Languages

Programming languages such as:

- C
- Java

can store small amounts of data using variables.

Example:

```java
String name = "Basha";
int age = 23;
String gender = "Male";
String branch = "ECE";
int studentId = 458;
int percentage = 93;

```

### Limitation

Programming languages are effective for storing small amounts of data but become difficult when handling large volumes of information because:

* Every value requires a variable declaration
* Data types must be specified
* Initialization is required for each variable

---

## DBMS (Database Management System)

DBMS was introduced to manage large amounts of data efficiently.

DBMS stands for:

**D** – Data

**B** – Base

**M** – Management

**S** – System

### Advantages of DBMS

* Stores large volumes of data
* Reduces redundancy
* Provides data security
* Supports efficient data retrieval
* Maintains data consistency

---

## Popular Databases

Some widely used database systems are:

1. Oracle
2. MySQL
3. Sybase
4. DB2

---

## History of Oracle

* In 1977, Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates founded Software Development Laboratory (SDL).
* In 1979, SDL was renamed to Relational Software Inc. (RSI).
* In 1982, RSI became Oracle Systems Corporation (OSC).
* In 1995, OSC was renamed Oracle Corporation.

Today, it is popularly known as **Oracle**.

## What is SQL?

SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**.

* Structured → Data is stored in tables.
* Query → Used to ask questions from the database.
* Language → Used to communicate with the database.

---

## History of SQL

* SQL was developed in 1970.
* Invented by Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin.
* SQL is also known as **SEQUEL** (Structured English Query Language).

---

## Structure of a Table

A table consists of:

### Rows

Rows are also called:

* Tuples
* Records

### Columns

Columns are also called:

* Attributes
* Fields

A table is also known as a **Relation**.

---

## Rules for Storing Data in a Database

1. Create a table.
2. Define columns with data types.
3. Insert records into the table.

---

## Creating a Table

### Syntax

```sql
CREATE TABLE table_name(
    column_name1 datatype,
    column_name2 datatype,
    column_name3 datatype
);

```

### Example

```sql
CREATE TABLE student(
    name VARCHAR2(16),
    age NUMBER,
    gender CHAR(6),
    branch VARCHAR2(16),
    id INT,
    marks INT
);

```

---

## Inserting Data into a Table

### Syntax

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES(value1, value2, value3);

```

### Example

```sql
INSERT INTO student
VALUES(
'Shaik Mahaboob Basha',
23,
'Male',
'ECE',
458,
93
);

```

---

## Important Note

In SQL, every statement ends with a semicolon (`;`).

The semicolon indicates the end of a SQL statement.
